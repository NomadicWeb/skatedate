         | Travelling and skateboarding is usually a great experience. We 
         | have found that meeting locals and finding spots is an
         | important part of making our trips feel meaningful, but
         | it doesnâ€™t always happen. 
         
       p 
         | Sometimes we cannot spend
         | long enough in one place to find the good spots or we
         | might be in an area with a small scene, and finding
         | locals becomes difficult. 
         
       p  
         | With our website we hope that 
         | we can help skaters in similar situations get the most out 
         | of their trips, while still maintaining the organic aspects of these
         | interactions. We want to help skaters connect and
         | improve their chances of experiencing the a scenes
         | unique skateboarding culture.
