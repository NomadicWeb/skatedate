### getting started

    npm install
    npm start

then hit localhost:3000.

### tips
 - when using `npm install <some_module>`, use instead `npm install <some_module> --save` so that the module information gets saved in the package.json. Any other developer who wants to get all the dependencies just has to run `npm install`.
