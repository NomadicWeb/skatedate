# What?
<site name> allows skateboarders who are travelling to easily find locals and spots at their destination. It also allows those locals to be notified of visiting skateboarders in their city.

# Who are we?
<site name> is comprised of three skateboards from Dublin. Paddy Walsh who is a graphic designer and who is currently residing in Dublin originally came up for with the idea for <site name>, currently paddy alongside with two other skateboarders from Dublin is working on a online publication showcasing the Dublin the skate scene. The other two founders of <site name> are Martin O'Grady and Luke Murphy who are two programmers who left Ireland last summer to build skateparks in Palestine for a charity known as SkatePal. Currently Luke and Martin are travelling around South America and are hoping to use <site name> to meet local skateboarders and to skate the spots their cities have to offer. 

# Why?
When travelling to cities that are way more less rinsed then lets say Barcelona or Berlin it can sometimes be a bit a nightmare trying to find spots to skate in the city you are visiting. Sometimes you can find yourself aimlessly wondering around the city looking for a certain spot you saw in a video or any spots at all, not to mention getting ripped off or ending up in the shitty overpriced tourists bars. Already experincing the majority of these problems first hand sometimes turning up to a city not knowing anyone is half the adventure and you get to meet rad locals but sometimes it doesnt always work out espeacially in cities that have little or no skateshops or skateparks.  

# The idea
<site name> is a website that allows you to post on it saying that you are arriving to a certain city in X amount of days, this will create a new thread that will notify the skaters of the city you are visitng. In the thread you can specify whatever you like, such as looking for directions to particular spot, looking for a list of spots the city has to offer or seeing if any locals would like to meet up for a skate around their city. We believe that this will cut out the time looking for spots which can be very valuable if your stay in the city is for short amount of time. We also believe that by using <site name> you can truely experince what the local skate scene of the city is like from hanging out locals discovering the cheap food places, good bars and right people who sell quality herb.  


# Problems
We have pitched the idea to various skaters we know to get some feedback, and some of the feedback we got were: how do you know the local you are meeting it is likeminded? how do you know you are not going to get shown around by a 12 year kid? What happens if you live in a city that has a lot of people passing through ? will you not just get a shit tone of notifications?

# What we need from you
Below we have a form which we welcome all suggestions on how to make the site better, if you have none thats cool, were looking for people to submit their email address so that we can get a rough idea if people are interested or if this idea sucks and nobody will use it. Thanks
