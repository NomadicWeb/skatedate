# What?
<site name> allows skateboarders who are travelling to easily find locals and
spots at their destination. It also allows those locals to be notified of
visiting skateboarders in their city.

# Who are we?
The <site name> team is made up of three skateboarders from Dublin, Ireland.

Paddy Walsh is a Graphic Designer who is currently residing in Dublin and
<site name> is his brain child. In his spare time he is working on an online
publication showcasing the Dublin skate scene. The remaining team members,
Martin O' Grady and Luke Murphy, who work as programmers left Ireland last
summer to build skate parks in Palestine for the charity called SkatePAL.
Currently, the two are travelling around South America and are hoping to use
<site name> to meet local skateboarders and skate the spots their cities
have to offer.

# Why?
When travelling to cities that have gotten much less international exposure
than, for example, Barcelona or Berlin, it can be a bit a nightmare trying to
find locals or spots. You can find yourself aimlessly wondering around the
city looking for a certain spot you saw in a video or any spots at all,
not to mention getting ripped off by locals or ending up in a terrible
and overpriced tourist bar.

Having already experienced the majority of these problems first hand,
arriving in a city and not knowing anyone is half the adventure when you get
to meet rad locals! However, it doesn't always work out especially
in cities that have little or no skate shops or skate parks.

# The idea
<site name> is a website that allows you to post your interest at a certain
location you will be travelling to in order to receive help from local
skateboarders. In your post, you can specify whatever you like, such as
looking for directions to particular spot, looking for a list of spots
the city has to offer or seeing if any locals would like to meet up
for a skate around their city.

We believe that this will cut out the time looking for spots which can be very
valuable if your stay in the city is for short amount of time. We also believe
that by using <site name> you can truly experience what the local skate scene
is like from hanging out with locals.

# Problems
We have pitched the idea to various skateboarders we know to get some feedback, 
and some of the feedback we got was: 
  - How do you know the local you are meeting is like minded? 
  - How do you know you are not going to get shown around by a 12 year kid? 
  - What happens if you live in a city that has a lot of people passing through?
    Will your account be completely spammed?

# What we need from you
We have provided a form on this page which we welcome all suggestions on how 
to make this service better, if you have no recommendations, that's cool, 
we are looking for people to submit their email address so that we can get a 
rough idea if people are interested, or if this idea sucks and nobody will use it. 

Thanks for reading.
