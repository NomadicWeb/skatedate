introduction
============
whereswall.ie allows skateboarders who are travelling to easily find locals and spots at 
their destination. It also allows those locals to be notified of visiting skateboarders.

about
=====
Martin O' Grady and Luke Murphy, two programmers from Dublin, Ireland who travelled to 
Palestine to build skate parks as part of the SkatePAL charity. They did this from June 
throughout August. Since then they have been travelling around South America and are hoping 
to use whereswall.ie to meet local skateboarders and skate the spots their cities have to offer.

why
===
Travelling and skateboarding is usually a great experience. We have found that meeting locals 
and finding spots is an important part of making our trips feel meaningful, but it doesnâ€™t 
always happen. Sometimes we cannot spend long enough in one place to find the good spots or 
we might be in an area with a small scene, and finding locals becomes difficult. With our website 
we hope that we can help skaters in similar situations get the most out of their trips, while 
still maintaining the organic aspects of these interactions. We want to help skaters connect 
and improve their chances of experiencing the scenes unique skateboarding culture.

idea
====
whereswall.ie is a forum-style website that allows you to post your interest at a certain 
location you will be travelling to in order to receive help from local skateboarders.  In 
your post, you can specify whatever you like, such as looking for directions to particular spot, 
looking for a list of spots the city has to offer or seeing if any locals would like to meet 
up for a skate around their city.  You can also set your current location and be notified of 
skaters visiting your area. You can give advice, send a list of lesser known spots or arrange 
to go for a skate and introduce the visitor to your scene.

problems
========
We've pitched the idea to various skateboarders we know to get some feedback, and some of 
the feedback we got was: 
 - How do you know the local you are meeting is like-minded?  
 - How do you know you are not meeting a 12 year kid?  
 - Account spamming if you live in a very popular destination?
